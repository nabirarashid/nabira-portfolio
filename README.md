# nabira-portfolio  

this is my personal portfolio website. it’s a place where i can share a little about myself, showcase my projects, and keep everything in one home on the internet. you can check it out here: [nabira-portfolio.vercel.app](https://nabira-portfolio.vercel.app).  

---

## why i made this project  
i wanted a central spot to share my work, projects, and experiences. i’ve been doing a lot of hackathons, coding projects, and astrophysics/physics-related work, and i wanted a site where i could bring all of that together in a clean, accessible way.  

---

## how i built it  
- framework: react  
- language: typescript  
- bundler: vite  
- styling: tailwindcss  
- deployment: vercel  
- version control: github  

i worked on building reusable components, playing with styling in tailwind, and making sure the site felt lightweight and responsive. vite made the dev process really smooth because of how fast the builds were.  

---

## struggles & learnings  
- i renamed my project folder midway (so in hackatime, the hours show up separately as `nabira-portfolio` and `personal-website`, even though they’re the same repo). it was a small thing, but i had to figure out how renaming affects linked services.  
- i ran into some tricky layout issues with responsiveness, but i learned how to better leverage tailwind’s flex/grid utilities and breakpoints.  
- i learned how vite handles hot reloading and builds, which gave me a better sense of how tooling impacts developer experience.  
- deploying to vercel taught me about handling project settings and automatic deployment from github.

## extra note (for athena award hour merge)  
hackatime doesn’t currently support project merging, so my hours are split across three “projects” in the ui. here are the names/links so they can be manually merged:  

- main repo: [github.com/nabirarashid/nabira-portfolio](https://github.com/nabirarashid/nabira-portfolio)  
- deployed site: [nabira-portfolio.vercel.app](https://nabira-portfolio.vercel.app)  
- hackatime project names: `nabira-portfolio` and `personal-website` (same repo, just different folder names at different times)

## what’s next  
i’d like to keep improving the portfolio as i learn more — maybe adding blog posts, more interactive sections, or better animations in the future.
